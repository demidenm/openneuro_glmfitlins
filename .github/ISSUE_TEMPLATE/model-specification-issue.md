The primary issue is...

## OpenNeuro Study

`ID`: ds000000
`spec file`:  ds000000-taskname_specs.json

## Issue with the specification

Compared to the current convolution, the regressors should be convolved using: `None`

Given the list of current regressors in the design matrix, the following regressors should be added: `None`

Given the list of the current regressors in the design matrix, the following regressors should be omitted: `None`

## Improvements from the model

This design matrix is a better estimate of the [...] process.
